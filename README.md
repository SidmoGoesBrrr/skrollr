# Skrollr

##Ever been on a book, or a pdf casually sipping a cup of coffee and being all comfortable only to realise you have to scroll down a little to read the next text?

Well I for sure have. I tried a bunch of stuff for this problem like programs which use AI to determine your reading pace or eye trackers... But all of these have proved inaccurate for me and different situations(for example reading a book for leisure and having a pdf of notes you need to write down will obviously have different scrolling speeds) So hear is a simple yet elegant solution I put together one night before my chemistry exam because reaching my mouse to scroll a little, while solving equations is just not fun!
